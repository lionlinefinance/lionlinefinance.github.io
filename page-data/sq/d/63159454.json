{"data":{"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Lionline","description":"Lionline is a massively scalable blockchain that is decentralized, permissionless and censorship-resistant without compromising security. Prototype shows that it can sustain 100,000 transactions per second with a block time of 0.2 seconds. The scalability is achieved without relying on any layer 2 solutions. Lionline would be partnering with other projects to leverage the super fast blockchain to build an ecosystem including a global peer-to-peer payment system, DeFi, and other business applications.","author":"Lionline"}}}}
